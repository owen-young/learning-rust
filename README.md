I am currently learning Rust. I am using these two books:
- https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html
- https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html

To develop, I am using emacs and vscode (although I've been liking vscode more recently for code completion and
automatic syntax checking....). I use the rust extension for vscode.
